# Boatnet.us---Source-Code
[1/13/17] Today I'm releasing boatnet.us source code, I'm releasing this because I have more important projects to work on such as cbooter &amp; I want to upload more tutorials on my channel! If anyone wants to continue my websites legacy go for it! Make sure to tag me on twitter! @Jihadi4Potus I'd love to see what you guy's changed!
