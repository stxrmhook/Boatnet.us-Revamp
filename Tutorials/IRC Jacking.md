How to trace IRC: 

1. Disable the modes that are set in your own IRC channel. Type ( /mode #Faded -CMmnt )

2. Once done type in this command  ( .cmd ss -n )

3. Or if you want to use netstat ( could possibly crash IRC ) but it's mostly for the windows bots type in ( .cmd netstat -n )

4. A list of IPs will show them connected to them always think the easiest port beside the irc : 6667

5. if its a (x.x.x.x:1111) 4x4 IP to Port then most likely its an IRC.

6. When you're done finding IRC's reset the modes in your own IRC channel. Type ( /mode #Faded +CMmnt )

When you're done remember type ( .ud.server IP PORT ) 

This will make a channel on your own IRC with the same name as from the channel you're jacking the bots from.
